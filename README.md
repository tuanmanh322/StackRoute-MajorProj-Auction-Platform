## Product: Second Hand Product Auction Platform 
## Description:
1.  People fantasy about having rare and antique things,but due to several odd reasons their dream of hoarding things remains unfulfilled.For example, if you are a Cricket Fan and you love Sachin's Batting Style, you would definitely love to have a Bat personally signed by the Master-Blaster himself.
2.  So,this Second Hand Product Auction Platform is one such platform where privileged people who feel like putting up their products for auction can easily do so.And the good part is,on this platform, the range doesn't matter you can place any product for auction.
3.  The sole purpose of this platform would be to make available the resources or products which are otherwise too costly to afford in the first place and secondly to make available the products for a stipulated time period,i.e sometimes you require a product for some short duration of time,for which you have to spend the whole cost to buy that and after its use you discard that. 
4.  The primary advantage of using this platform would be you would get multiple interested buyers who would bid to get your product.The buyers would bid according to the range specified for the product i.e if the product is 2 years old,then a minimum % of its original amount should be kept its starting range. And hence the product would be ready for bidding.And as per the bidding rules,the product goes to the highest bidder.
